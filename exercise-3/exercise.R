# Exercise-3: Calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my.name` that contains your name
<<<<<<< HEAD
my.name <- "Simran Bhatia"

# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters are in your name (use the `enchars()` function)
name.length <- nchars(my.name)
=======


# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters are in your name (use the `nchar()` function)

>>>>>>> info201-w17/master

# Print the number of letters in your name


# Create a variable `now.doing` that is your named followed by "is programming!" to the end of your name
# (use the `paste()` function)


# Make the `now.doing` variable upper case
<<<<<<< HEAD
toUpper(now.doing)

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to `fav.1` and `fav.2`
fav.1 <- 8
fav.2 <- 18

# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save it as the same variable
fav.1 <- fav.1 /sqrt(201)
fav.2 <- fav.2/sqrt(201)

# Create a variable `raw.sum` that is the sum of those two variables. Use the `sum()` function for practice
raw.sum <- fav.1 + fav.2

# Create a variable `round.sum` that is the `raw.sum` rounded to 1 decimal place. Use the `round()` function
round.sum <- round(raw.sum)

# Create two new variables `round.1` and `round.2` that are your `fav.1` and `fav.2` variables rounded
# to 1 decimal place
round.1 <- round(fav.1)
round.2 <- round(fav.2)

# Create a variable `sum.round` that is the sum of the rounded values
sum.round <- round.1 +round.2

# Which is bigger, `round.sum` or `sum.round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
max(round.sum, sum.round)
